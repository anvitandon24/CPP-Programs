Introduction
-Arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming that allow you to store multiple values in a single variable. This repository aims to provide a thorough understanding of arrays through well-organized sections covering theory, practical questions, and illustrative examples.

Basics of Arrays
In this section, you will find detailed explanations of the following topics:

What are arrays?
- How to declare and initialize arrays
- Accessing array elements
- Modifying array elements
- Array properties and methods (specific to programming languages)
- Advantages and limitations of arrays
Each topic is accompanied by code snippets in various programming languages to help you understand the concepts better.

Common Questions
This section contains a list of frequently asked questions about arrays. Here, we cover:

~ How do arrays differ from other data structures?
~ What are multidimensional arrays and how are they used?
~ How can you iterate through arrays efficiently?
~ What are some common array operations (e.g., sorting, searching)?
~ How do you handle array-related errors?
Each question is answered with clear explanations and code examples to solidify your understanding.

Examples
To help you apply the theoretical knowledge, this section includes practical examples of array usage. Examples cover a wide range of scenarios, such as:

-> Basic operations (insertion, deletion)
-> Advanced operations (merging, splitting)
-> Problem-solving using arrays (e.g., finding the maximum/minimum element, reversing arrays)
-> Real-world applications of arrays
Examples are provided in multiple programming languages to cater to a diverse audience.
